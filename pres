This case highlights a P90 error scenario where the forecasted production rate significantly increases when the production data is extended to 12-18 months.
After 12-18 months, the forecasts begin to overlap and stabilize, indicating a more accurate and reliable prediction.
As we can see on the graph, our EUR prediction after 60 months of data compared to the forecast after 6 months is almost double
Although, this may seem alarming, it is important to remember that the bulk of our data is much closer to our p50 case.


Our analysis indicates a significant uncertainty in EUR predictions for the initial 6 and 12 months of production data.
As the production data is extended to about 12-18 months, the uncertainty range significantly tightens, and the predictions become much more stable.
This stabilization suggests a more reliable forecast after incorporating a sufficient amount of production data.
Concluding Remarks:

The observed trend remained consistent regardless of how the data was filtered, underscoring the robustness of the findings.
